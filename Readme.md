# .Net Image Optimiser

This project was created using the ImageCrunch project from Mads Kristensen Image Optimiser externsion for Visual Studio.
The extension can be found here: http://madskristensen.net/post/Image-Optimizer-(beta)-VS2010-extension.aspx

This command line application gets all the images in a folder structure and uses smush.it or punypng online services to optimise the images, rewriting them in the process.

List of Features
* Ability to point to a folder and optimise all the images contained in the full folder structure.
* Error codes returned if there is any errors so you can easily put on your build automation scripts.

Work to do
* Add option to error on image process error.
* Decompile ImageCrunch and add classes to the main executable.
* Add parallel processing.
* Fix Stylecop errors.

You can also logon into test users accounts with the details facebook sends you.

I will welcome any pull requests, bug reports or feature requests.

Hmm...Muffins.
